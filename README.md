## About the project

This project is a remake of the nextjs-blews repository. It is mainly for proof of skill!
To overcome the burden of NDA. It is ficticious in terms of names and positions.
Where the nextjs-blews uses Nextjs, clerk (for authentication) and convex for backend to store images or cloth info in general, this project uses Nextjs, cloudinary for storing images and MongoDB for storing other cloth details including references to the cloudinary images. It is ongoing and has better experience for users in terms of loading states!
